# The Lazy DM's Workbook - The App

The Lazy DM's Workbook, by Michael E. Shea (aka SlyFlourish), is an outstanding publication that builds on his previous work to make DMing simpler, more fun, and overall more epic. I'm designing this app to dynamically generate content from it with the click of a button to make my life easier. All credit for the work goes to SlyFlourish. I hope that, one day, I'll be able to share this with him.
