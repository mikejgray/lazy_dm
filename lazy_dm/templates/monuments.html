<h2>Monuments:</h2>
<p>Filling the various chambers and locations in your game with interesting features is always a challenge—and can be even more difficult to improvise. The “Monuments” page presents four tables that can generate fantastic features with a number of potential effects. As with the “Traps” page, you don’t need to roll on every table each time you want to generate a feature. Sometimes, just establishing the condition and the type of a feature is enough to give you a starting point. Then you can let the story or even the background of one of the characters guide the feature’s additional elements. 

<p>The Unusual Effect table can come into play whenever you want a feature to add interesting effects to a combat encounter. You can use the improvised statistics in the “Fifth Edition Reference” section to flesh out the mechanics for these effects or simply tie the effect to a spell.
